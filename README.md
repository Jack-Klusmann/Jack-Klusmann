# 👋 Hey, I'm Jack

I'm a Master's student in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at TUM, currently conducting my thesis as a visiting researcher at the Soft Robotics Lab at NUS.

My research focuses on learning-based control and simulation of spiral-shaped soft continuum robots.

🧠 Areas I’m digging into:
- Soft robot kinematics and dynamics (MATLAB, Python)
- Soft robot simulation (MuJoCo, Python)
- Intuitive user interaction for soft robots with high dexterity (Unity)

🚧 Projects in progress below. Always up for feedback, ideas, or collaboration!
