# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Jack

I'm a Master's student in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at TUM, currently conducting my master's thesis at the Soft Robotics Lab at NUS.

My research focuses on the control and simulation of spiral-shaped soft continuum robots.

ðŸ§  Areas Iâ€™m digging into:
- Soft robot kinematics and dynamics (MATLAB, Python)
- Soft robot simulation (MuJoCo, Python)
- Intuitive user interaction for soft robots with high dexterity (Unity)

I'm especially interested in learning-based methods for robot control.

ðŸš§ Projects in progress below â€” always up for feedback, ideas, or collaboration!
