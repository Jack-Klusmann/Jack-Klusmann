# 👋 Hi, I'm Jack

👨‍💻 I’m a Robotics Researcher and Engineer. My ambition is to leverage machine learning to create meaningful human–robot interaction and bring robots into everyday life, both as assistive partners and intuitive companions.

🤖 My current work explores data-driven control and high-fidelity simulation of spiral-shaped soft continuum robots.

🔍 What I’m currently working on:
- Investigating geometry-informed approaches for soft robot kinematics and dynamics
- Building soft-robot simulation pipelines, including real-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer
- Integrating soft robots into rigid manipulators
- Realizing human–robot interaction for hybrid rigid–soft robots using mixed reality

🙂 Feel free to explore my projects!
